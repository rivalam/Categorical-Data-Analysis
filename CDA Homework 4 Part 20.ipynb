    "### In an investigation of the relationship between stage of breast cancer at diag-nosis (local or advanced) and a woman’s living arrangement (D. J. Moritz and W. A. Satariano, J. Clin. Epidemiol., 46: 443–454, 1993), of 144 women living alone, 41.0% had an advanced case; of 209 living with spouse, 52.2%were advanced; of 89 living with others, 59.6% were advanced. The authors reported the P-value for the relationship as 0.02. Reconstruct the analysis they performed to obtain this P-value.\n",
