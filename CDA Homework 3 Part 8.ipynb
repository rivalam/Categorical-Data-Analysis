An Associated Press story that described the study stated “Doctors were only 60% as likely to order cardiac catheterization for blacks as for whites.”What is wrong with this interpretation? Give the correct percentage for this interpretation. (In stating results to the general public, it is better to use the relative risk than the odds ratio. It is simpler to understand and less likely to be misinterpreted. For details, see New Engl. J. Med., 341: 279–283, 1999.)\n",
