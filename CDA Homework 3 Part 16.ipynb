    "#### Table 2.12 comes from one of the first studies of the link between lung cancer and smoking, by Richard Doll and A. Bradford Hill. In 20 hospitals in London, UK, patients admitted with lung cancer in the previous year were queried about their smoking behavior. For each patient admitted, researchers studied the smoking behavior of a noncancer control patient at the same hospital of the same sex and within the same 5-year grouping on age.A smoker was defined as a person who had smoked at least one cigarette a day for at least a year.\n",
